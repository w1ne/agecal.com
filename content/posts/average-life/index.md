Genetics and family history shape life expectancy to some degree. But lifestyle choices have proven to be crucial. Behaviors like smoking, poor diet, and lack of exercise are directly linked to major diseases and lower lifespans. Alcohol and drug abuse also cut lives short. Individuals can make choices to boost longevity, like eating healthy, exercising, avoiding substances, and managing stress.

Life expectancy has risen substantially in modern times. The global average was only 31 years in 1900 compared to 72.6 years today. Advancements in medicine, vaccines, neonatal care, and treatment for conditions like infectious diseases have extended lives. But more progress is still needed to improve life expectancy worldwide. Disparities remain based on socioeconomic factors. Yet the potential exists for people everywhere to live longer through innovations in healthcare and healthier lifestyles.

The First Decade: Birth to 10 Years
===================================

The first decade of life is critically important for establishing health and longevity. Global average life expectancy at birth has risen dramatically, from about 31 years in 1900 to over 70 years today. However, significant inequities persist, with life expectancy at birth ranging from 50 years in some developing nations to over 80 years in developed countries.

In the first year of life, mortality rates are highest. Advances in sanitation, nutrition, and healthcare have reduced infant mortality, yet over 5 million children under age 5 still die each year worldwide. Important milestones like responding to sounds and smiling typically occur in the first 2-3 months. Early motor skills such as sitting, crawling, and walking mark the first year. Language skills emerge rapidly - most children say their first words by 12 months and form short phrases by age 2. Social skills, problem solving, and emotional regulation also develop. Access to nutrition, healthcare, early education, and nurturing care improve outcomes.

Between ages 1 and 5, major causes of mortality include pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, and undernutrition. Development continues very rapidly - mobility improves dramatically during the toddler years and language blossoms. By age 5, most children can dress themselves, count to 10, draw representational pictures, and engage in cooperative play with others. School readiness emerges around ages 3-5 as executive functions like working memory, self-control, and focus grow. Success in early education is associated with lifelong benefits.

From 5-10 years, growth slows but development continues. Fine motor skills improve - children gain competence and confidence in activities like sports and artistic pursuits. friendships grow in complexity and peer interactions help children hone social skills. Abstract thinking emerges, along with deeper logical reasoning abilities. However, injuries are a major cause of death in this age group globally. Investments in health, nutrition and education continue to provide lifelong dividends. Overall, cultivating nurturing, stimulating and safe environments in the first decade sets the stage for longevity.

The Second Decade: 10 to 20 Years
=================================

Average life expectancy for humans entering their second decade of life hovers around 60 additional years globally. However, this number varies significantly based on geographic location and access to healthcare.

The early teen years mark the beginning of puberty. Hormonal changes fuel rapid growth and development. Teens experience a major growth spurt and put on lean muscle mass. Sexual maturation occurs. For girls this means menstruation and breast development. Boys experience voice deepening, facial hair growth and increased musculature.

Lifestyle factors like diet, exercise and sleep patterns established during adolescence impact long-term health. Obesity rates climb as teens gain independence over food choices. Many abandon regular physical activity. Irregular sleep schedules driven by school demands and social lives can negatively affect health. Risky behaviors like alcohol, tobacco and drug use also emerge during the teen years.

Globally, the leading causes of death for 10-19 year olds are road injuries, HIV/AIDS, suicide and interpersonal violence. But with access to quality healthcare and adoption of healthy lifestyles, most young teens in developed nations will live well into their 70s, 80s or beyond.

Steering through adolescence requires navigating biological, cognitive and social changes. Avoiding harmful vices and establishing healthy routines improves the odds of living a long, productive life. With proper guidance and support, teens can adopt lifestyle practices to maximize longevity.

Adulthood: 20 to 60 Years
=========================

Globally, the average life expectancy for both men and women by age 20 is approximately 60 more years, putting life expectancy around 80 years old. However, there are significant variations between countries, genders, and socioeconomic groups.

Entering adulthood marks a transition to greater independence and responsibility. Lifestyle choices during this period can greatly impact health and longevity. Proper nutrition, regular exercise, avoiding substance abuse and high-risk behaviors, and managing stress can extend lifespan.

Average Life Expectancy Past Retirement Age
-------------------------------------------

In developed nations, both men and women can expect to live into their 80s, on average. However, women tend to outlive men by several years in most countries. Those in the healthiest quartile of the population at retirement age may enjoy life spans past 90 years of age. Genetics, lifestyle factors, and access to healthcare all influence longevity.

Health Concerns and Lifestyle Changes
-------------------------------------

The leading causes of death start to shift in one's 60s and beyond. Chronic conditions like heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes pose the greatest mortality risks. Maintaining an active lifestyle with a healthy diet can help mitigate these risks. Social engagement also promotes emotional wellbeing. Retirement requires major lifestyle adjustments as well.

The Impact of Modern Medicine
-----------------------------

Medical advancements over the past century have added decades to average life expectancies globally. Improved diagnosis, pharmaceuticals, surgical techniques extend lifespans.

However, disparities in access to modern healthcare persist.

Variations in Life Expectancy
=============================

Life expectancy varies significantly based on geographic location and socioeconomic status. In developed countries, average life expectancy is around 80 years. However, in less developed regions of the world, life expectancy is much lower, often below 70 years of age. Access to healthcare, clean water, nutrition, and sanitation all impact one's lifespan.

Areas with high rates of infectious diseases, such as parts of Africa and Asia, tend to have lower life expectancies. War and civil conflict also dramatically reduce life expectancy. Even within countries, there are disparities. The wealthy and educated often live longer than the impoverished. A person's race, ethnicity, and gender can also correlate with differences in longevity.

Lifetime access to high-quality medical care is a key predictor of life expectancy. Preventative care, screening tests, and treatment for illnesses enable early diagnosis and interventions. However, millions worldwide lack basic health resources. Enabling universal healthcare access could increase global life expectancies. Health behaviors like diet, exercise, and avoiding smoking also correlate with longer lives.

Advances in medical treatments, as well as improving living standards globally, are likely to increase longevity over time. However, without addressing systemic healthcare and economic inequities, major gaps in life expectancy will remain between the privileged and disadvantaged. More progress is needed to improve health for all.
